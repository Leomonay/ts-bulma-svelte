## Svelte

### (and differences with ReactJS)

* Less code
* No Boilerplate
* No virtual DOM -> Compiles JS, HTML, CSS. Prepares itself to recognize how will work each component when it has an event.
* .svelte files --> html files divided in blocks
* Svelte prepares css
* Svelte includes store. No redux needed.
* Sapper: prepares server subrender, routing, refreshes.
* Svelte Native for mobile apps.
* CSS scope integrated.
